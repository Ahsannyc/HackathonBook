# Context7 Server Integration

This page describes how the Docusaurus site is integrated with the Context7 MCP server.

## Connection Status

The site is configured to connect to the Context7 server to fetch and display documentation content.

<Context7TestComponent />

**Status Update:** The Context7 integration has been successfully implemented and tested. The plugin is properly loading and the connection status component displays the connection status as expected.

## Configuration

The connection is established through a custom Docusaurus plugin located at `src/plugins/context7-connector.ts`. This plugin:

- Connects to the Context7 MCP server
- Fetches documentation resources
- Provides client-side functionality to interact with the server

## Usage

The integration is transparent to users but provides enhanced documentation capabilities through the Context7 server.
